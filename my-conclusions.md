Procedural programming is based on writing sequences of instructions grouped into functions. 
It focuses on what the program should do step by step. It works well for small and simple tasks, as the program grows, it can become harder to manage and reuse the code.

Object Oriented Programming organizes code around objects. Each object contains both data and behavior. This makes it easier to build complex systems, reuse code, and keep things organized. 
OOP helps protect data using encapsulation, and allows flexibility through inheritance and polymorphism.

Procedural programming is like writing a recipe, while OOP is like designing a machine with parts that work together. 
Both have their strengths, and the choice depends on the size and complexity of the project.
